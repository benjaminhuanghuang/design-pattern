# Builder Design Pattern
## Intent
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
Parse a complex representation, create one of several targets.

## Problem
An application needs to create the elements of a complex aggregate. The specification for the aggregate exists on secondary storage and one of many representations needs to be built in primary storage.

有点像Template Method。Template Method 关心操作，builder关心创建
