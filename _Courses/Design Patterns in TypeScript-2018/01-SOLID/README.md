# Ch01 SOLID Principles

- Single Responsibility: A class should have only one reason to change
- Open/Closed principle: Open for extension, closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution: Also know as substitutability. If C is a subtype of E then E can be replaced with objects of type C without changing or breaking the behavior of the program
- Interface Segregation: Class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use
- Dependency Inversion: Classes should depend on abstractions not on concretions
