# Design Pattern

## What
某类问题及其解决方案的核心， 可复用， OO

Flexibale, maintinable ane extensible

- Creational patterns are focused on instantiating objects in a way that hides the mechanisms of their creation from the rest of the program. Make decison at run time.
 
- Structural patterns simplify the **relationships and hierarchies** between different classes and how they can be used to build larger and more complex entities. 
 
- Behavioral patterns provide common ways objects can **communicate** with one another


## Target
- 松耦合设计思想
- OO design 原则
  - 封装，隐藏内部实现
  - 继承，复用现有代码
  - 多态，改写对象行为
- Refactor, better design


## How
- 静态       ->  动态
- 早绑定     ->  晚绑定
- 继承       ->  组合
- 编译时依赖  ->  运行时依赖
- 紧耦合     ->  松耦合
