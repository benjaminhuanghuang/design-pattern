# Proxy Design Pattern
## Intent
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
Use an extra level of indirection to support distributed, controlled, or intelligent access.
Add a wrapper and delegation to protect the real component from undue complexity.

## Problem
You need to support resource-hungry objects, and you do not want to instantiate such objects unless and until they are actually requested by the client.
