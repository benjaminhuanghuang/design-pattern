# Interpreter Design Pattern
## Intent
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
`Map` a domain to a language, the language to a grammar, and the grammar to a hierarchical object-oriented design.

## Problem
A class of problems occurs repeatedly in a well-defined and well-understood domain. If the domain were characterized with a "language", then problems could be easily solved with an interpretation "engine".
