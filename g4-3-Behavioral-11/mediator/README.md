# Mediator

## Intent
The intent of the mediator pattern is to define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. 

It does that by forcing objects to communicate via that mediator. 

By doing so, it promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it also lets you vary their interaction independently.
