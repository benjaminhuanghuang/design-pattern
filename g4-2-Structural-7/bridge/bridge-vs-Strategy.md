## Bridge Pattern
So bridge is a two-dimensional concept. 
Think of one dimension (the rows) being the list of methods that need to be implemented, and the second dimension (the columns) being the Implementors who will implement each one of those methods.

Example 1: Apps and devices
Example 2: Odbc database drivers and odbc functions

## Strategy pattern
This pattern lets the algorithm that executes vary independently from the clients that use it.
